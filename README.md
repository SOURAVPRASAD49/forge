Forensics Oriented Reporting Group Under Encryption

## Ideology
**This project is follows the belief of Sir Abraham Lincoln**
> You can fool *all* the people *some* of the time and *some* of the people *all* the time,
> But you cannot fool *all* the people *all* the time.

## Introduction
FORGE or Forensics Oriented Reporting Group Under Encryption is a network system for secure transmission of directives among two or multiple authentic users. It uses asymmetric key cryptography to ensure an end-to-end encryption scenario.

## Features
* Directives are stored in eavesdrop-free encrypted format in the server
* Every user has a unique 64-byte PKCS identity to recognize with
* Encryption uses a brute-force resistant timestamp based keypair generation
* Asymmetric key cryptography - 2048-bit RSA used for directive protection
* One-way encryption strategy - 512-bit SHA used for storing passwords
* Group sharing uses double layer protection with group's own keypair 
* Capable of one-to-one directive sharing using *composition*
* Capable of one-to-many directive sharing using *broadcast* and *groups*
* State-of-the-art session management and user access control
