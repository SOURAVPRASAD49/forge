    "## Introduction\n",
    "FORGE now supports a low-level, lightweight and efficient RESTful API with optimal endpoints. The talk-to-server frequencies are kept to a bare minimum to enforce anonymity. Also the requests and responses are designed to minimize network activity. The *stateless* endpoints provided by the FORGE RESTful API are listed in the following lines. These greatly rely on the client-side application on how the security is maintained."

    "## Design\n",
    "1. The API is HTTP-based so all requests and responses would come across as JSON documents with GET fetches.\n",
    "2. Every successful response from the server would have a `retncode` index to state operational status.\n",
    "3. Some responses from the server can consists of an array of JSON documents or nothing at all.\n",
    "4. Application should imbibe security-by-design principles to avoid undue load of bad requests to the API servers.\n",
    "5. There is a need of session management implemented inside the application as responses are stateless."
